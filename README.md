Apache Hadoop https://mapr.com/products/apache-hadoop/
distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models

* s/MapReduce/Cloud Dataflow/     Reasons:
- hard to ingest data rapidly
- (too) many different technologies
- batch & streaming unrelated
- deployment & operation of clusters always required
